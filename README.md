This research investigates the application of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for weather forecasting, leveraging the capabilities of the Google Colab environment. The primary objective is to develop a robust model capable of predicting crucial weather parameters, including minimum temperature, maximum temperature, 9 am temperature, 3 pm temperature, and rainfall. The study utilizes a historical weather dataset, subjecting it to rigorous preprocessing steps such as handling missing values through forward-filling, transforming the data into a time series format using a sliding window approach with a sequence length of 30 days, and scaling numeric features using StandardScaler to ensure optimal model performance. The dataset is then divided into training and testing sets using an 80/20 split
A multi-output LSTM architecture is designed and implemented using the Keras API, comprising an input layer, two LSTM layers with dropout for regularization, and five dense output layersâ€”one for each target variable. The model is trained using the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001 and the mean squared error (MSE) loss function. Early stopping is employed as a regularization technique to prevent overfitting, halting the training process if the validation loss does not improve for 10 consecutive epochs.
This research underscores the potential of LSTM networks as a powerful tool for weather prediction tasks. Furthermore, it highlights the convenience and efficiency of using Google Colab for data science projects, providing a readily accessible platform for data loading, preprocessing, model development, training, and evaluation. Future research directions include exploring hyperparameter optimization techniques to fine-tune the model's performance, incorporating additional weather-related features such as wind speed, humidity, and atmospheric pressure to enhance its predictive capabilities, and deploying the model as a web application or API to provide real-time weather forecasts for practical use.
